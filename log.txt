v0.1:

- Model Classes added with first empty methods
- Ideas for tests added (still to implement)
NOTES:
-- "Extract" and "Place" and "Use" methods have ints as parameters, not Objs.
This was thought to make calling this methods easier, starting from the GUI (Client)
This will make flexible positioning in arrays and grids not possible in the Model.
-- A "Enum" Class has been added, to keep the design simple. In order to use those types, for now, *extends Enum*.
-- Schemes and Cards are yet to be implemented. CardHandler and Scheme are classes made for pairing elements of the game with data.

v0.2

- ToolHandler and PubObjHandler made static. Added static public attribute with the number of cards
- Added the "Utility" Class, to create specific algorithms for data management
NOTES:
-- The "static" attribute was added in order to call methods without creating instances of the object.

v0.3

- Implemented: Box, Dice, Table (constructor)
- Added tests on dice
NOTES:
-- Added ANSI code to colors
