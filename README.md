## Short description
Final test of the software engineering course (A.Y. 2017/2018).  
Realization of "Sagrada" game.

## Notes for the use
The program is composed by both GUI and CLI, and by both socket and RMI connections. For details about JAR parameterization please refer to [config_README.md](/Deliverables/config_README.md)

### GUI
The final rank is shown to the last player when he clicks the "End turn" button; other players can also visualize the last game screen clicking the "End turn" button after last player's turn.

We have implemented a "Refresh" button in the main game screen, which needs to be clicked whenever a game action is performed (dice placements, tool cards usages, turn changes). A Drop Shadow effect will guide you in your gaming experience!

## Game's short description 
- 4 Window Frame Player Boards;
- 12 Window Pattern Cards;
- 12 Tool Cards;
- 10 Public Objective Cards;
- 5 Private Objective Cards;
- 90 Dice (18 x 5 Colors - red, yellow, green, blue, purple)
- 1 Dice Bag;
- 1 Round track;
- 4 Score Markers;
- 24 Favour Tokens;
- 1 Rules.

You are an artist competing with fellow artists to create the most beautiful stained glass window in the Sagrada Familia.

Your glass pieces are represented by dice, which have a color and a shade - indicated by the values on the dice (the lower the value the lighter the shade).

Each round, players will take turns drafting from a pool dice, placing these dice on their window. Players must place them within the color and shade restrictions on their Window card, and never have adjacent dice of the same color or value.

After 10 rounds, players score points based on public and private objectives - the highest scoring artisan is the winner!
